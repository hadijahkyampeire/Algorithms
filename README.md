# Algorithms

You can think of programming algorithm as a recipe that describes the exact steps needed for the computer to solve a problem or reach a goal or a step-by-step procedure, which defines a set of instructions to be executed in a certain order to get the desired output.

In this repo I share about the `Search`, `Sort` and `Hash` algorithms. Each in its folder with examples.

## Search
- Searching Algorithms are designed to check for an element or retrieve an element from any data structure where it is stored.

## Sort 
- A Sorting Algorithm is used to rearrange a given array or list elements according to a comparison operator on the elements. The comparison operator is used to decide the new order of element in the respective data structure.

## Hash
- A hashing algorithm’s goal is to generate a safe hash. 
- Shortly, the hash value is a summary of the original data. For instance, think of a paper document that you squeeze and squeeze so that, in the end, you aren’t even able to read the content.
